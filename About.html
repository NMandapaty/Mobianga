<h3>About Mobianga</h3>
<br>
<p>
Mobianga is essentially a matching game. Given a gene as a prompt, research journal articles and find the disease most 
closely linked to that gene. The most important part is that the game doesn't know if your answer is the correct one! Using 
previous answers on the same prompt, we compare your answer to others to determine how many points to award. By harnessing the power of 
the crowd to parse information, we hope to build an accurate database linking each gene to a disease.

<h3>About the Creator</h3>
<br>
<p>
My name is Nishant Mandapaty, a 17-year-old high school senior from Naperville, Illinois. I am
interested in both biology and computer science, and therefore am very attracted to
the emerging field of computational biology. 
</p>
<p>
I have been working with Dr. Benjamin Good at SuLab beginning in the summer of 2012, after finding 
their group through the Google Summer of Code program. I plan to submit the results of my experiment with this game
to the Intel Science Talent Search competition.
